Hello! My name is Lu√£ Reis,
I am a molecular biologist specialist in neuroscience and toxicology.

I got my Ph.D. in molecular biology and biochemistry at the Federal University of Bahia (Brazil) and did postdoctoral research at Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). My research is focused on developing toxicological models for neuroscience, as well as, developing neuronal hypothalamic models derived from iPSC. 

This GitHub repository is my portfolio, where I showcase a compilation of my R programming codes that I have used for statistical analysis.
