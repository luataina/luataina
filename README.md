Hello!
My name is Lu√£ Reis, I am a molecular biologist specialized in neuroscience and toxicology, and this GitHub repository is my portfolio. 
I have got my PhD in molecular biology and biochemistry at Federal University of Bahia (Brazil), and did a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet (Sweden).
Here I showcase a compilation of my R programming codes that I have used for statistical analysis.
