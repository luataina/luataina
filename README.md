Hello, my name is Lu√£ Reis. 

I am a molecular biologist specialist in neuroscience and toxicology.

In this portfolio, I demonstrate R programming workflow and statistical analysis, such as:
- Descriptive statistics
- Inferential statistics
- Factorial experiment design
- Response surface method (3D factorial optimization)
- Experimental optimization (Linear programming)
- Linear regression
- Multiple regression
- Central limit theorem
- Decision tree (machine learning)

I got my Ph.D. in molecular biology and biochemistry at the Federal University of Bahia (Brazil) and did postdoctoral research at Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). My research is focused on developing toxicological models for neuroscience, as well as, developing neuronal hypothalamic models derived from iPSC. 

I am a math enthusiast, trying to see biological problems through a mathematical lens, and here I showcase a compilation of R programming codes that I have used for my research statistical analysis.
